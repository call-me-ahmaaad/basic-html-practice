# ðŸ“• Basic HTML Practice
This repository is my first step in relearning HTML. This repository is my practice project to create a simple display using images, links, tables, and several other essential HTML components.

The inspiration for this project was the page of an Azur Lane character, KMS Bismarck. Why? Because I like it and don't know what's the best option for this initial stage :P

In the future, I will try to recreate it using CSS to beautify and make it as similar as possible to the original. Of course, I will write the program code myself without copying the default web page.

## ðŸ¤” What I learned?
At this stage, I understand how to use some basic HTML components like links, images, tables, and so on. Another key aspect is how to structure HTML semantically.
